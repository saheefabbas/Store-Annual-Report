# Store-Annual-Report
I made an annual report for a "Vrinda Store" where I depicted the observations of 6 Problem Statements.
Started with basic data cleaning and data processing to remove the null and unnecessary values from the dataset, added columns of Age-Group and Months to further make the data more useful.

Major Findings are below:

1. Monthly Sales & Orders
2. Top 5 States with Sales Perspective
3. Orders by Age-Group and Genders
4. Order Status 
5. Sales by Gender
6. Total number of Orders by Channels
